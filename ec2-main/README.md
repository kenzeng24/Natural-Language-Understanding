# EC 2: PyTorch Exercises
**Due: February 27, 9:30 AM**

For this extra credit assignment, please complete the _problem set_ found in `ec2-pset.ipynb`. The problem set includes 
only written problems. Since this extra credit assignment is optional, you are welcome to submit 
partially completed solutions.

Please submit your answers in PDF format, using the filename `ec2-written.pdf`. Make sure
to clearly mark each problem in order to minimize the chances of grading errors.

You do not need to submit anything for Problem 1.

You are free to use any resources to help you with this assignment, including books or websites. You are also free
to collaborate with any other student or students in this class. However, you must write and submit your own answers to
the problems, and merely copying another student's answer will be considered cheating on the part of both students. If
you choose to collaborate, please list your collaborators at the top of your `ec2-written.pdf` file.

## Setup

This problem set requires [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). Problem 1 will guide you through the setup 
process if you do not have these dependences installed already.

## Submission

For your submission, please upload your `ec2-written.pdf` file to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com).

Do not change the names of this file, and do not upload any other files to Gradescope. Failure to follow the
submission instructions may result in a penalty of up to 5 points.

## Grading

The point values for each problem are given below. 

| Problem | Problem Type | Points |
|---|---|---|
| 2a: The PyTorch Tensor | Written | 2 |
| 2b: Tensor Data Types | Written | 3 |
| 2c: Creating Tensors | Written | 3 |
| 2d: Differentiation | Written | 3 |
| 2e: PyTorch vs. NumPy Operations | Written | 3 |
| 2f: More Operations | Written | 2 |
| 3a: Chaining Modules Together | Written | 3 |
| 3b: Recurrent Neural Networks | Written | 3 |
| 3c: Calculating Gradients | Written | 3 | 
| **Total** | | **25** |

### Rubric 

For all problems, you will receive:
* full points if your answer is correct (according to the TAs' judgement) 
* 0 points otherwise.

Partial credit will **not** be awarded.

## Late Submissions and Resubmissions

Late submissions will **not** be accepted. You may resubmit your solutions as many times as you
like until the deadline, after which submissions will be closed.
