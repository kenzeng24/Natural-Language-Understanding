You should not submit this notebook with your solutions, and we will not grade it if you do. Please be aware that code written in a Jupyter notebook may run differently when copied into Python modules.\n",

Please refer to the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/) for detailed instructions specific to your machine. You can also install PyTorch directly from this notebook by running one of the following two code cells; this is recommended if you are running this notebook on Google Colaboratory or some other web-based Jupyter notebook server."
