    "In the following exercises, you will need to implement functions defined in the `numpy_exercises` module. Please write all your code in the `numpy_exercises.py` file. You should not submit this notebook with your solutions, and we will not grade it if you do. Please be aware that code written in a Jupyter notebook may run differently when copied into Python modules.\n",

    "This notebook comes with outputs for some, but not all, of the code cells. Thes outputs are the outputs that you should get **when all coding problems have been completed correctly**.

    "For this course, you are strongly encouraged to download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), a free Python distribution that includes the `conda` package manager and comes with most of the packages you need (including NumPy) pre-installed. If you do not have Anaconda installed already, you should choose the latest version of the Individual Edition. Anaconda comes with a number of Python packages that are essential to working with neural networks, as well as the conda package manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have enough disk space for Anaconda, you can choose to install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) instead. Miniconda a version of Anaconda includes Python as well as the `pip` and `conda` package managers, but does not come with NumPy or other tools pre-installed. \n",

    "If you choose to use Miniconda or an existing Python installation,<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1) please ensure you have the following installed.\n",
    "* Python 3.5 or a later version\n",
    "* The `pip` package manager or `conda` package manager. If you don’t have either package manager, please install pip by following the [official instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical way to install NumPy is to simply run `pip install numpy` or `conda install numpy`. Please refer to the [NumPy installation instructions](https://numpy.org/install/) for detailed instructions specific to your machine. You can also install NumPy directly from this notebook by running one of the following two code cells; this is recommended if you are running this notebook on Google Colaboratory or some other web-based Jupyter notebook server."
