# EC 1: NumPy Exercises
**Due: February 8, 9:30 AM**

For this extra credit assignment, please complete the _problem set_ found in `ec1-pset.ipynb`. The problem set includes 
coding problems as well as written problems. Since this extra credit assignment is optional, you are welcome to submit 
partially completed solutions.

For the coding problems, you will implement functions defined in the Python file `numpy_exercises.py`, replacing the 
existing code (which raises a `NotImplementedError`) with your own code. **Please write all code within the relevant 
function definitions**; failure to do this may break the rest of your code.

For the written problems, please submit your answers in PDF format, using the filename `ec1-written.pdf`. Make sure
to clearly mark each problem in order to minimize the chances of grading errors.

You do not need to submit anything for Problem 1.

You are free to use any resources to help you with this assignment, including books or websites. You are also free
to collaborate with any other student or students in this class. However, you must write and submit your own answers to
the problems, and merely copying another student's answer will be considered cheating on the part of both students. If
you choose to collaborate, please list your collaborators at the top of your `ec1-written.pdf` file.

## Setup

This problem set requires Python 3 and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). Problem 1 will guide you through the setup 
process if you do not have these dependences installed already.

## Submission

For your submission, please upload the following files to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com):
* `numpy_exercises.py`
* `ec1-written.pdf`

Do not change the names of these files, and do not upload any other files to Gradescope. Failure to follow the
submission instructions may result in a penalty of up to 5 points.

## Grading

The point values for each problem are given below. 

| Problem | Problem Type | Points |

| 2b: Array Shapes | Written | 1 |
| 2c: Indexing | Written | 1 |
| 2d: Arithmetic Operations | Written | 1 |
| 2e: Matrix Operations | Written | 1 |
| 2f: Batch Matrix Multiplication | Written | 1 |
| 2g: Axis-Wise Operations | Written | 1 |
| 2h: Reshaping | Written | 1 |
| 2i: Copying | Written | 1 |
| 3a: Sigmoid Function | Code | 2 |
| 3b: Zero-Centering | Code | 2 |
| 3c: Select Even Rows | Code | 2 |
| 3d: Masking | Code | 2 |
| 3e: Compute Accuracy | Code | 2 |
| 4a: Matrix Multiplication in Pure Python | Code | 3 |
| 4b: Comparison of Pure Python with NumPy | Written | 3 |
| **Total** | | **25** |

### Rubric for Code Problems
Code questions will be graded using a series of [Python unit tests](https://realpython.com/python-testing/). Each
function you implement will be tested on a number of randomly generated inputs, which will match the specifications
described in the function docstrings. **The unit tests will run immediately upon submitting your solution to
Gradescope, and you will be able to see the results as soon as the tests have finished running.** Therefore, you are
encouraged to debug and resubmit your code if one or more unit tests fail.

For code questions, you will receive:
* full points if your code runs, passes all test cases, and respects length restrictions for Problem 3
* 0 points otherwise.

Partial credit will **not** be awarded.

### Rubric for Written Problems

For Problem 2, you will receive:
* full points if your answer is correct (according to the TAs' judgement) 
* 0 points otherwise.

For Problem 4b, you will receive:
* full points if your results are reported correctly and your conclusions are consistent with your results
* 0 points otherwise.

Partial credit will **not** be awarded.

## Late Submissions and Resubmissions

Late submissions will **not** be accepted. You may resubmit your solutions as many times as you
like until the deadline, after which submissions will be closed.
